## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
1-Advanced Filtering:  Go beyond just location. Allow users to filter facilities based on the type of e-waste they accept (batteries, TVs, computers, etc.), any fees associated with drop-off, and any data wiping services offered.

2-Incentive Integration: Partner with responsible recyclers to offer reward programs.  This could involve points for dropping off e-waste, redeemable for discounts or donations to environmental causes.

3-Sustainability Information:  Educate users!  Integrate information about the environmental impact of e-waste and the benefits of proper recycling.  Provide links to resources for responsible e-waste disposal practices.

4=Mobile Optimization:  People are on the go!  Make sure your locator is mobile-friendly for easy access when people are de-cluttering or upgrading electronics.  Consider adding features like distance calculation and turn-by-turn directions.

## Use Cases
## 1-Individual Users:
Spring Cleaning/Decluttering: Imagine someone decluttering their garage and coming across a box of old electronics. They can use the E-waste Locator to find a facility that accepts their specific items (e.g., old monitors, unused gaming consoles).
Upgrading Electronics: Someone might be replacing their laptop or smartphone. The locator can help them find a responsible recycler for their old device.
Moving House: People moving often end up with unwanted electronics. The locator can help them dispose of these items properly before or after their move.
Businesses and Organizations:

## 2-IT Asset Management:
Companies often upgrade their computers and other equipment regularly. The locator can help them find a trusted e-waste recycler that ensures secure data wiping and proper disposal.
Event Planning: Organizers of electronics trade shows or e-waste collection events can use the locator to promote participating recycling facilities.
Public Services:

## 3-Municipal Outreach Programs: 
Local governments can utilize the locator as a resource for residents looking to dispose of e-waste responsibly. This can be integrated into their sustainability initiatives.
School Recycling Programs: Schools can use the locator to find facilities that accept e-waste generated from their computer labs or classroom electronics projects.


## Technology Stack
## 1-Frontend:
Web Framework: Popular choices include React, Angular, or Vue.js for a web-based locator. For a mobile app, consider native development with Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android) or cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
JavaScript Libraries: Libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps Javascript API can be used for integrating interactive maps and location features.

## 2-Backend:
Programming Language: Languages like Python, Java, or Node.js are commonly used for server-side development.
Database: A database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB is needed to store information on e-waste facilities, including location data, types of e-waste accepted, fees, etc.
APIs (Optional): Depending on your features, you may integrate with APIs for services like geolocation, user authentication (if needed), or distance calculation.

## 3-Additional Considerations:
Mapping Service: Choose a mapping service like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to display facility locations.
Geolocation: If allowing users to search based on current location, consider implementing geolocation features.
Data Security: Ensure secure storage and transmission of user data, especially if collecting location information.

## 4-For a more advanced E-waste Locator:
Machine Learning: For waste identification, you could explore image recognition models to help users identify their e-waste type.
Push Notifications: For location-based reminders or updates on nearby facilities.
This is a general guideline, and the specific tech stack will vary based on your project's needs and complexity.


## Dependencies
## 1-Functional Dependencies:
These are the essential features and functionalities that the E-waste Locator needs to fulfill its purpose. They define what the app or website should do. Here are some key functional dependencies:
## Search Functionality: 
Users should be able to search for e-waste facilities by location (zip code or geolocation) or by a specific type of e-waste they want to recycle.
## Display Facility Information:
The locator should display relevant information about nearby facilities, including:
Name and address
Distance from user's location
Types of e-waste accepted
Any associated fees
Data wiping services offered (if applicable)
## Optional Features:
Depending on your goals, you might consider additional functionalities like:
Ability to filter results based on specific criteria (fees, data wiping, etc.)
Educational content about e-waste and responsible disposal practices
Integration with user accounts for storing preferences or tracking recycling history
